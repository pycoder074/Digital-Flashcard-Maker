Validation ,Checking that data is acceptable by comparing it against a set of criteria.,Other
Variable ,An identifier associated with an area of computer memory in which data is stored. The data can change during program execution.,Other
Vector ,An abstract data type that defines a collection of entries drawn from the same field.,Other
Vector graphic ,An image that is stored as a set of instructions to recreate it. Uses a drawing list made up of a set of objects and their properties.,Data Structures
Venn diagram ,"An illustration that uses circles to show the relationships between different groups of elements. Where the circles overlap, it shows that there are elements in common.",Other
Vernam cipher ,An encryption method where each character is combined with a corresponding key character using a logical bitwise XOR operation.,Other
Vertex ,A fundamental unit of data within a graph data structure. Also called node.,Other
Virtual network ,A network whose logical structure is independent of its physical structure. A VLAN is a virtual local area network.,Other
Virtual Storage ,"A method of using a shared storage device, sometimes connected to the internet, that a user can access as if it were local storage.",Other
Virus ,Malware in the form of a program that attaches itself to another file and can replicate itself when the file is executed.,Other
Visited list ,The set of nodes of a graph that have been fully explored,Other
Visualisation ,A variety of techniques used to illustrate a problem and/or its solution to make it easier to understand.,Other
Volatile memory ,Memory that only retains data when there is power to the device.,Computer Systems
Von Neumann architecture ,A computer architecture that provides a single shared memory for data and instructions.,Other
VPN ,"Virtual private network. Extends a private network across a public network (such as the internet), allowing secure access to systems and data.",Other
Vulnerability ,"A weakness in a computer system that leaves it open to attack, such as an insecure wireless network or unpatched software.",Other
Waterfall lifecycle ,A linear approach to software development where each stage is completed before the next stage begins.,Other
Websocket protocol ,A set of rules that allows two computers to share a dedicated channel for the exchange of web page content.,Other
Weight ,A value associated with an edge in a graph.,Other
Weighted graph ,A graph where values are assigned to the edges.,Data Structures

Wide area network (WAN) ,"Two or more distinct networks connected together, usually covering a large geographical area.",Other
Wireless Access Point (WAP) ,A network device that manages wireless connections to a local area network.,Other
WLAN ,Wireless local area network. Uses wireless communication protocols to connect devices on a local area network.,Other
World Wide Web (WWW) ,"A collection of hyperlinked content accessible on the internet, usually web pages.",Other
Worm ,Malware that is able to replicate itself and does not need to use another file as a vector.,Other
WPA/2/3 ,Wi-Fi Protected Access v2/3. A protocol for encrypting data on a wireless network.,Other
Write mode ,"A file handling mode that allows a program to write data to a file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created, while if the file already exists, the content is overwritten.",Other
XML ,Extensible Markup Language. An open file format that uses human-readable text for data transmission.,Other
XOR ,"A Boolean operation that outputs True if either, but not both, of the input values are True",Other
